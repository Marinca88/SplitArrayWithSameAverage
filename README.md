# Split array 

In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C.
B and C are initially  empty.
We must  return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.

## Running Tests

The solution  contains a test library. For testing it is  enough to  uncomment //testLibrary::test();  from  main  in Source.cpp.
